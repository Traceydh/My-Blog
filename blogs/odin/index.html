        <h1>Is The Odin Project worth it?</h1>

        <main>
            <p> I first started my coding journey in uni while studying a bachelors of Biomedical engineering, I did the intro the python course and I can confidently say I was not inspired to continue coding. Fast forward 6 years, after working a few years in orthopaedics I quit. </p>

            <p> I left Sydney lockdowns and travelled with my boyfriend for a year. I spent this year trying learning lots of different things - trying to find my passion but nothing stuck.. </p>

            <p> My boyfriend casually mentioned I should try coding, I've thought about it before but I had such a negative impression of it from my uni days - I always thought I didn't have a 'developer's brain'. I thought I couldn't learn it and that it was too hard. </p>

            <p> I played around with JavaScript on Khan Academy - and it was definitely not easy - but so much more fun that I had anticipated. The feeling of solving a problem gave me joy and felt like my brain was alive again. After finishing Khan Academy I wanted more, after reading lots of forums and googling I decided to complete The Odin Project - Foundation. Here is my experience and what I learnt.</p>

            <h2>How long does it take?</h2>
            
            <p> I started in March 2022, it is now May 2022. (Although I haven't finished it yet) I did not put in serious hours until May, when we were in Bali and when I returned to Sydney.
            In total: 3months 
            </p>

            <h2>What did I actually learn?</h2>
            <p>OH BOY what did i not learn? In fact I made this website as practice. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the internet works</li>
                <li>What is Github and version control</li>
                <li>HTML, CSS, JS technical</li>
                <li>Problem solving mindset</li>
                <li>Debugging - there are so much tools!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and there's so much more to learn</p>

            <h2>Have I gotten a job?</h2>
            <p>No not yet! I still don't feel ready to apply for jobs so will be continuing my studies with the next course </p>

            <h2>What next?</h2>
            <p></p>
