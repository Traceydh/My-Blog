                <h3> What is memory?</h3>
                <p>There are a few different types of memory
                    <ul>
                        <li>short term: working memory</li>
                        <li>long term</li>
                        <li>explicit memory: things that we can declare to know </li>
                        <li>implicit memory: thing that we unconsciously know e.g. walking</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>The hippocampus is where we form but not store, explicit declarative memory. Implicit memories are formed elsewhere - in the cerebellum or neocortex. Patient called H.M had part of his hippocampus removed due to severe seizures, after the procedure he was not able to form any new memories but could retain his past memories.</p>
                </p>
                <h3> Why do we remember some things and not others?</h3>
                <p>Some factors to why we remember certain events over others are </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Association: how well a fact or memory is linked to the context of our lives</li>
                        <li>Repetition: the more a particular neuron circuit in a particular chain is activated the stronger it becomes</li>
                        <li>Emotion saliency: we are more likely to remember emotionally intense events positive or negative </li>
                        <li>Release of adrenaline/epinephrine and/or cortisol: in response to the emotionally laden event these hormones are released and this is what causes a memory to stick</li>
                    </ul>    
                <p>This was shown by study conducted where the researchers made participants either read a boring paragraph or emotionally charged paragraph. The participants were able to remember the emotional paragraph better however, if the students read the boring paragraph plunged their arm in ice water after reading they remember just as much as the emotional participants. When their adrenaline release was blocked by pills, they no longer remembered the paragraph as well - key finding showing that it is the release of adrenaline that causes this increase in memory.</p>
                </p>
                <h3> Tools to improve memory</h3>
                <p> Knowing this we can use the following tools to increase adrenaline and cortisol AFTER a learning session
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cold showers </li>
                        <li>Drive caffeine towards the end of your study session, can drink slightly before finishing the session as it will take a while for caffeine to kick in</li>
                        <li>Go for a hard intense workout after studying </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Some other tools which are also helpful
                    <li>Spaced repetition </li>
                    <li>Exercise: cardiovascular exercise in particular has been studied more has been shown to support dentegris neurogenesis which is important for forming memories. Recommended minimum zone 2 cardio is 180 - 200min a week. It has been shown that exercise releases the hormone osteocalcin from bones, which performs a variety of functions, but also encourages electrical activity in the hippocampus which maintains its function of forming new memories.</li>
                    <li>Meditation: study by Wendy Suzuki showed that a 13min meditation session will improve memory formation and focus. It has the side effect of increasing alertness - which is beneficial if you meditate in the morning instead of night time. </li>
                    <li>Another study mentioned by Huberman stated that the act of taking a photo - that you desire - of landscapes will improve memory retention. This also applies to mental photographs - where you just blink and act like you're taking a photo with your eyes. However, this act does decrease the auditory memories associated with that place. </li>
