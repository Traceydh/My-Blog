                    <h2>No one teaches us how to make decisions</h2>
                    <p>Decision making one of the most important skills we can develop as a human, it directly affects the quality of our lives and those we love. We're all human which means we are not rational decision making machines - we are plagued by our desire to defend our ego unconsciously. This book by Chip Heath has a detail thinking process guide which I still use every chance I get, I can say without a doubt it has significantly improved my thinking. </p>
                    <p>The most important deicison you can make in life (which people spend far too little time considering, myself included) </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who we spend time with? (romantic partner, friends)</li>
                        <li>Where we live?</li>
                        <li>What we do?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The key points of this book is conveniently summarised with a mnemonic: WRAP </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>W</b>iden your options </li>
                        <li><b>R</b>eality test assumptions: confirmation bias makes us blind, devil's advocate, zoom in and out, scootch</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>ttain distance: short term emotions can cloud judgement</li>
                        <li><b>P</b>repare to be wrong: probablistic thinking, tripwires, bookend, understand over-confidence</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Widen your options</h3>
                <p>When we encounter a problem we have a tendency to think "should i do this or that?" effectively, narrowing out options to two ultimatums. Whenever we make a decision and we find ourselves with only a few options this should be a red flag. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do the vanishing option test on yourself: what would you do if you couldn't do any of your current options?</li>
                    <li>Always consider the opportunity cost of making a decision - what will you miss out on? Is there also an opportunity cost by NOT making a decision?</li>
                    <li>When we are swamped with choices it makes it harder to decide e.g. buying electronics online</li>
                    <li>Multi-tracking: we could even test multiple options as once - to better understand the scope of the problem and this process we enable us to detach our ego from our choice. E.g. have multiple teams working on designing a different solution each to the same problem</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help make the decision look for advice from people that have been in the same situation before, this person could even be yourself. It is also important to be aware that humans can be in either a </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>prevention mindset</li>
                    <li>promotion mindset</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Encourage a balance view, look for good opportunity while being cautious of huge risks. To avoid errors follow/devise a checklist of questions which help stimulate new ideas and avoid failure. Include both prevention and promotion focused questions. </p>

                <h3>Reality-test your assumptions</h3>
                <p>We all have a tendency to confirm our own beliefs - this happens unconsciously even if we think we are rational, known as the confirmation bias. Combine with our overconfidence in our own ability to predict the future - recipe for miscalculations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have an devil's advocate: What are benefits for the opposite view? what are the weaknesses of your view? If you don't have pros and cons for both sides, your stance hasn't been thought through thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>If working in a team, to help everyone drop their attachement to their "solution", ask "what needs to be done in order for this to work?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can never know for sure if we making to the right choice, so if possible try out the solution before fully committing e.g. internship at veterinary hospital before committing to a full degree. To optimally gather information we need, we can use two types of questions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probing questions: Specific and direct, this is good for people that have an ulterior motive as it reduces lying and we can get the facts</li>
                    <li>Broader open ended questions: ask for base rates and statistical general data this is good when talking with experts so that their own biases don't get in the way.This is because humans are terribly over confident in making future predictions even while knowing past trends.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Overcome short-term Emotion</h3>
                <p>The reason why we experience strong emotions when facing a decision is because it is causing an internal conflict between two different values. Most of the time we are not even aware of what those conflicting values are, really think about what each choice represents and see what truly matters to you. To avoid getting caught up in strong emotional pulls we can</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask yourself how would you feel in 10min, 10months and 10years about this decision? Long term thinking is often harder to choose.</li>
                    <li>If you were a 3rd person, how would they advise you? Or ask someone not related to the decision</li>
                    <li>What are you values? enshrine and identify the most important ones. Money? Family? Comfort? Happiness? Passion?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prepare to be wrong</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before humans are terrible are predicting the future, to avoid disasters</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the range of possible outcomes? What's the worst and best case scenario - how can you prepare for both?</li>
                    <li>Inversion thinking - ask yourself "This failed, why?" To avoid a catastrophe </li>
                    <li>To avoid sunk cost fallacy/status quo bias - make a tripwire, decide on a condition which indicates that you've made the wrong choice and you can't keep investing in this choice.</li>
                </ul>
